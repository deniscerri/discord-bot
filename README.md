Dev environment:

After cloning the project you have to install the npm libraries: cd to the project root directory and then:

```sh
npm install
```
Don't forget to provide your own API Keys in your .env file. All API's used in the bot are free and available for everyone to use.
Alot of the bot's commands are powered through REST API calls.
I thank every developer that have made the projects this bot depends on. :)
